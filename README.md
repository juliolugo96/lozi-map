# Globally Coupled Lozi Map simulation

Globally coupled Lozi map with two populations simulation and plotting using C++ and GNUPlot. You can take a look to the basic concepts of this chaotic system [here](http://www.ciens.ula.ve/cff/caoticos/PDFs/SEM_170706.pdf). This software was made exclusively and used by venezuelan physicist Rebeca Leon in her ***Quimeras en redes de osciladores caóticos hiperbólicos*** (ULA, 2017).

## Requirements

- [GNUPLOT](http://www.gnuplot.info/)

## Usage

1. Compile using *g++*
2. Execute as follows:

``` shell
    [./your_chosen_name.exe]    [epsilon value]   [beta value]    [mu value]    [population i size]   [population j size]   [Total iterations]    [Threshold]
```
